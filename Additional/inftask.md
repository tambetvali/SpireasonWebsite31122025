Let's define a system called "Infinity Constant Simulator" and made by Tambet Väli under cc-by-nc-sa-4.0 for public education:

I have defined infinity as r, radius, of a circle which appears flat. As limits are taken in each direction of the circle, infinity is point reached when the circle becomes flat. This is associated with local flatness of earth.

Zero is defined as one divided by this infinity, the inverse of the infinity.

When circle r is smaller than infinity in the center scroll of the scale, or middle of the animation, a rectangular rhomb is drawn on visualization in square area: center of each side of the square is one point on the rhomb. When number is finite, to the zero on the left, the circle is drawn: in it's initial size the radius touches the rhomb at four points. When number is accelerated, it appears in accelerated space: of the square, each of four courners is a center for 1/4 of the circle, so 90 degrees of it appear inside: from each four corners, 90 degrees of the circle appear towards inside; when it is infinitesimal above infinity, the next fragment 1 unit from center to right, it's a circle touching the line from each square center-directed dimension, so that the circle never passes inside the rhomb; as the other circle touches the center at first unit left, but does not extend outside the rhomb at any point, exactly touching it with radius at middles of it's size in direction to corners of the square.

One can move that fractional-discrete slider:
- Left and right are exactly zeroes.
- Middle is exactly middle so there are odd number of steps.
- Next step left and right from the middle comes in perceivable units and they are selectable with mouse, just as center and the edges, thus the units are not too small.
- From left to this step before center, and from step after center to the end: the steps go linearly, and even the movement could be smooth.

When rhomb appears, it's infinity; between center (infinity) and zero is "1", a step.

This task is complete as we only simulate the most simple idea: the simulation does not need any beyond-understanding.

Still, https://spireason.neocities.org/, https://assorted-canopy-961.notion.site/Laegna-1a575bfc115480a38129e9a9787ab565 and https://github.com/tambetvali/LaeSpiEssentialTheorems are my theories and one of the base expressions is there: the base constant of infinity. Can you point out the texts and follow my philosophies and use them for design inspiration, to combine this simple classic math simulation with Laegna environment; and show where the infinity constant is particularly declared, used and summarized so that there is context around: inside, the context does not disturb and it appears as a simple calculator of infinity constant.

Left from infinity is "E" (write it upside the scale): the previous point is exactly a circle touching the rhomb, where the rhomb is not coloured unless exact infinity at the center is touched.

Right from infinity the next step is "5" (upside the scale as it's the constant): this is four quarter-circles outside, coloured to outside, touching the circle.

When slider is scrolled further away from infinity, the rhomb does not appear.

The circle inside: to zero, where it disappears, it linearly grows smaller and is the only thing shown, always shown.

The circle exside: this is topological projection of this ring-like dimension also connecting outside into a reverse-square, much as if each 1/4 of the box was moved into it's opposite corner, such as moving bottom-left quarter to top-right quarter etc.: in such case a circle would be visible and it would shrink to zero size.

The edges: left is Zero, and upside the "U" should appear.

Right is not zero, but infinity squared (which should apper below the scale), and marked with "V" or better yet, U which is flipped vertically so up is down and down is up, the particular character. One has to imagine that at corners, there is the center as well where the outwards-square projects to the center.

Marked points:
- Center is infinity.
- Left is zero.
- Pre-center last step is lower limit to infinity.
- Post-center is upper limit to infinity, from above.
- Right is "infinity / zero" equal to "infinity squared" (Inf^2 or in one case size of R^2).

I want online widget, where one scrolls the slider and sees the simulation of a circle. Notice a point between center and left side, zero and infinity, is also important: it's "1". It defines the unit size. Scroller should have step for each of those points.

Radius at E, the left step from inf: this should not be to touch the corners of the rhomb, but radius which touches the centers of it's sides.

Outwards radius: it has imaginary box, where each 1/4, dividing the square into 1/2 in horizontal and vertical axe, each quarter is separate square: the outwards-corners, original corners, are anchors and each square is moved to put the corners to center. This is not to be implemented as real space: instead, a filled circle is imagined in this position, and each 1/4 of the circle is actually projected to positions as if the corners were not moved to the center. This explanation should provide step-by-step algorithm.

Write from draft. Create the full implementation: outside, growing to the right, it's what I call "reverse" of the original circle, as if the center grows into infinity - it's actually outwards-curved and coming down from exponential space. The exponent is linearized down outwards: this is the mathematical concept, poorly visualized in space which does not grow exponentially like this to still keep it consistent circle; so the squares are moved and it's illustrated as if the center is outwards, where only the dimensional size and not exact positioning is displayed - it's the best display I can do.

Can you also display the factors: project the below-infinity linearly into first octave, and above-infinity into the second, making it represent a second-order octave, 4^n in place of 2^n and fragment-count-root-of-fractional-division using also the higher growth rate than, for example, 12 for musical note. Square growth is linearized, coming from 4^n and not 2^n. Properties of this exponent growth are linearized into 1/4 of this linearized acceleration, creathing this basic graph.

Imagine it into drawing a circle into 1/4 boxes in 1/4 division, and optionally the diagonal lines to appear as a rhomb, filling this only exactly at the middle; when outside center is approached, each such simple square is shrinking to "outwards zero" but the same frames are used in reverse, with two squares switched on both diagonals.

Outwards it grows in reverse: it approaches outwards zero when reaching infinity squared, linearly from the middle, not backwards. The whole scale outwards is reversed, as if the first side was inversed yet appearing fit.

yes give a new version and make the coordinates fit: use circle size internally, from 0 to 1 to 2, and imagine from 1 to 2 is like from 1 to 0 towards external inf^2 seen as zero, growing to where one cannot see it. The 8^n is inversed then into normal coordinate space from higher space not visible by hilbert.
